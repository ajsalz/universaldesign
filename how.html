		<h2>The Seven Principles of Universal Design</h2>

		<ul class="principles">
			<li>Equitable Use: Provides users with the same experiences.</li>
			<li>Flexibility in Use: Accomodates a wide range of preferences and abilities.</li>
			<li>Simple and Intuitive Use: easy to understand regardless of prior knowledge, skills. or circumstance.</li>
			<li>Perceptibe Information: communicates information effectively and is compatible with different technologies.</li>
			<li>Tolerance for Error: Minimizes hazards as well as makes it so unintended actions are easily reversible.</li>
			<li>Low Physical Effort: Can be used efficiently and is comfortable for all users to navigate.</li>
			<li>Size and Space for Approach and Use: there are no other physical (digital) barriers that limit user. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Implementing Universal Design</h2>
		<h3>Let's look at color</h3>
		<p>One of the ways we can look at equitable use is through color. Choosing a color palette that has a strong contrast is an example of putting this principle into use.</p>

		<p>There are a lot of tools available now in order to check color contrast. There are also pre-designed palettes availbe for use. There are a lot of options for you when it comes to color contrast checkers.</p>

		<h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
		<p>This means you have formatted your HTML properly and this can be great for increasing the perceptibility of your information. Semantic HTML primarily focuses itself of the meaning of the contents and what things are. Websites that are properly formatted are easier for assisstive technologies and search engines to determine what's important.</p>

		<h3>Fonts matter</h3>

		<p>Sans-Serif fonts tend to be easier for people to read.</p>

		<h3>Subtitles</h3>
		<p>If you are using video content on your website, make sure that it has subtitles or transcriptions.</p>

		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>Turn on your own accessibility features and see if your website is still usable. Try voice-over and keyboard navigation.</p>

		<p>A great tool for testing is <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a>. It will check contrast, html, and alert you to any concerns.</p>

		<h3>Listen to the Community</h3>
		<p>There are plenty of conferences, events, TedX videos, etc. where you can listen to other people's experiences. Beyond just watching and learning, it's also good to test your product with users of all abilities. There are things you are not going to catch especially if you yourself do not experience a certain disability.</p>
