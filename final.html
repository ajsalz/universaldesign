		<h2>What is this place?</h2>
		<p>The internet has the potential to break down barriers. People today have unprecedented access to information, media, and each other. So, it’d be crappy of you to design something that built barriers instead of bringing them down. Don’t worry though, that’s why I made this website. Here you’ll find tools and information on how to create a completely accessible website using UNIVERSAL DESIGN. That way you can be a cool person instead of a...not cool one.
		</p>

		<div class="unaccessible">
			<figure id="redCircle">
				<img src="images/onePercentGraphic.png" alt="A red circle filled with text 
				 1 percent of websites meet accessibility standards" />
			</figure>
			<h2 class="callToAction">Be a part of the 1%</h2>

		<h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
		<p>
			Universal Design is about designing for as many people as possible. It assumes that everyone has different abilities and access, and the design is built on that assumption. Universal Design is different from Accessible Design because Universal Design is about beginning the design process by considering as many needs as possible, whereas Accessible Design is typically built then adjusted to meet other needs.
		</p>
		<p>For example, consider an automatic door and one that opens when pushed by a handicap button. An automatic door opens the same way for every person and meets the needs of more people as it doesn’t require a button to open. A handicap button though is meant only for situational use, and still requires that step of pushing the button which is not always an option for people. </p>
		<div class="doorExample">
			<figure>
				<img src="images/handicapButton.png" alt="a handicap button that you push and that activates the door to open">
				<figcaption>a handicap door button.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/automaticDoor.png" alt="A closed automatic door that opens by sliding in and out of place.">
				<figcaption>An automatic door</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</div>
		<p>There are many factors that will change how someone is able to interact with something. Sometimes it's physical or sometimes it's something we can't see. Sometimes it's economic factors. The burden shouldn't have to be on the user. Universal Design is about being a responsible designer, and making it easier for the user to navigate the world around them.</p>
		<p>If you're not sold yet, explore this page. This page will tell you why you should join a group of designers and advocates who aim to make the web invlusive of all abilities and circumstances. It will also teach you how to do that, and give you some great tools to do so.</p>
