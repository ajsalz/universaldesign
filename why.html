		<h2>What is a disability?</h2>
		<p>According to the CDC, a disability is defined as "any condition of the body or mind that makes it more difficult for the person with the condition to do certain activities". To think about Universal Design, it's helpful to re-think this defiition as "more difficult for the person with the condition to do certain activies the way they are being done". Disabilities aren't always restrictive, instead they foster innovation.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's estimated that nearly 15% of the world's population experiences some form of disability. That's a lot of people. However, disabilites manifest themselves differently for each person. There is no one "look" or experience, and there is a whole range of abilities. But let's break it down.

		</p>

		<h3>Types of Disabilities</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Sensory: these impact one or more of the senses: sight, hearing, smell, touch, or taste</li>
			<li>Physical: these impact someone's functional abiity or mobility.</li>
			<li>Cognitive: these typically impact mood, behavior, and how people learn.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>These can be genetic, a result of a major life event, or sometimes circumstantial. For example, things like fog or concerts impact the senses. Sometimes people are restricted by other factors like socioeconomic class and a lack of resources. It's important to understand that is no clear-cut way to think about disabilities.</p>

		<h2>The Case for Universal Design</h2>

		<h3>There are many benefits to universal design:</h3>

		<ul class="principles">
			<li>Our own individual lives are easier to navigate.</li>
			<li>It's cost effective. It's usually cheaper to design for everyone than to make adjustments later. </li>
			<li>It gives you a larger audience</li>
			<li>It promotes equality.</li>
			<li>It's just the right thing to do.</li>
		</ul>
